you can commit an existing filr without stagging.... That is possible for a file that has once be added to the staging enviromnment. 
You cannot commit an untracked file directly, you have to stage is before you can commit it.
Your file can either be a tracked or untracked file. And only tracked file can be committed or modified tracked file but not new file.
